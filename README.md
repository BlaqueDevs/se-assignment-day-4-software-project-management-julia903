## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile: focuses on iterative, flexible development cycles that incorporate frequet customer feedback.
Advantages: flexibility is adaptable and responsive to change, client satisfaction can lead to higher client satisfaction.
Disadvantages: inadequate documentation can cause a lack of documentation which can make it difficult to understand, need for expertise this could require a high level of exertise
Waterfall: focuses on a linear sequentail process with distinct phases and prioritizing detailed upfront planning.
Advantages: clear requirements the model redefines requirements before development starts, well-structured the model is well structured and organized
Disadvantages: high risk the model may not be well-suited for projects with high requirements that may change

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile can more beneficail than waterfall because agile has better customer feedback and is crucial and there is a need for flexibliity to adapt to needs throughtout the development process. Waterfall works very well with teams that do not require constant collaboration or not have to work independently without contast communication

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

This ensures quality assurance throughout a software project can implement defing clear quality standards, conducting throrguh software testing across diffenet stages, untilizing automated testing tools and performing code reviews and monitoring performance. It is very important to maintain high standards because it leads to a reliable , efficient, user-friendly product and reduces maintenance costs which improves customer satisfaction and enhances the company's reputation.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Our software focuses on inefficient communication between teams, lack of project visibility and poor task management and this aims to streamline workflows and enhanc accountability and imrpove overrall project efficiency.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?

With considering the affected areas and specifying by things you can reasonably address and with prioritizing the problem and the potential impact it may have.

# 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?

Main features and functionalities that mak software stand out usability, reliability testablility, scalability and many more other features.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?

The market size and growth potentail grow bigger everyday for software users.

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
It is important to understand market trends because it is essential for businesses, as it provides insights into how the market landscape evolves.
